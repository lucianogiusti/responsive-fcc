                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Javascript_and_Java">
            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>
                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
                escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
            <header>Global variables</header>
            <p>
                Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window,
                so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
            </p>
            <code>
                var x = 42.
            </code><br>
            <code>
                x = 42.
            </code><br>
            <code>
                let y = 13.
            </code>
            <p>
                Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or
                frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared
                in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <p>
                You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier
                is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can
                contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                <br><br>
                <code>
                    const PI = 3.14;
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has
                to be initialized to a value.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword
                is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable
            </p>
            <code>
                const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
            </code>

                <ul>
                    <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                    <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                    <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                    <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                    <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not
                        the
                        same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                </ul>
